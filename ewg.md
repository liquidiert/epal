# The epal writing guidelines
First things first - you don't have to stick to this rules - but you should! 🙆‍♂️  
The parser is written for these guidelines and will work best when using them.  
Tabs are not obligatory but make much more beautiful code :)
So let's start:
- Tabs (I like them a lot [coming from python 😁] so they are the first point)
- each comment has it's own line
    - block comments start after their first line
- **Always** put **one** whitespace between words (again it's the parser🤷‍♂️)

(the ewg can change according to epal development)
